            <p id="txt">At the beginning we decided to do <em>task(a)</em>.<span id=F>F</span>irst we build our folders structure to our website to make it easy
                 to use links inside our pages.So, we made images, docs, home, resume, portfolio & about folders. images and documents 
                 folders to gather all our images and documents in one place. Then we create a template (<span id=index>index.html</span>) page putted in it
                  the standard elements for Html5 for example <span id=blue>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span> and (meta viewport) to guarantee our web pages be
                   suitable to most devices.
            </p>
            <p>
                After that we discussed about the person that we will describe in our portfolio site. It was our friend Mohannad Falah,
                 you can notice that not all information is correct, but just for demonstration. So, we got his resume and create 5
                  assignments for each of us (we are 5 students).
                Then we agreed that we must tag our elements with class or id to make styling easier after wards. 
                We discussed also if we can use embed style in <span id=head>&lt;head&gt;</span> but we after we agreed to make it linked and embed style
                 sheet, that what help us to made one time styling for standards then embed styling for individual pages.
                We upload our folders to github and all our changes apply it to github. So, in this way we made our site alive.
