        <p> A cartoon is a type of illustration that is typically drawn, sometimes animated, 
         in an unrealistic or semi-realistic style. The specific meaning has evolved over time, 
         but the modern usage usually refers to either: an image or series of images intended for satire, 
         caricature, or humor; or a motion picture that relies on a sequence of illustrations for its animation. 
         Someone who creates cartoons in the first sense is called a cartoonist, 
         and in the second sense they are usually called an animator.Here you can read more about the 
         <a style="color: blue;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartoon"> Cartoon </a> art.

        <p> <strong> Here i want to show you some of the most important works that i have done as a cartoonist:</strong> </p>

        <h2 style="color: rgb(252, 145, 6);" title="The first cartoon"> Boss and Leader </h2> 
        <p>Through this artwork, I want to clarify <q> the difference between Boss and Leader </q>.
            Where a boss manages their employees, while a leader inspires them to innovate, think creatively,
            and strive for perfection. Every team has a boss, but what people need is a leader who will help them
            achieve greatness. True leaders frequently present ideas and work alongside their employees.
            They clearly communicate objectives to the team and their actions are aimed at achieving goals together. 
            This is the difference between inspiring team members and losing their respect. 
            When a team has confidence in a leader, it can help improve team culture and motivate employees to contribute.

        <h2 style="color: darkblue;" title="The second cartoon"> Heart or Mind </h2> 
        <p> By this cartoon i want to send a message that <q> through balancing the mind and the heart, life continues</q>.
            Between our minds and our hearts there is a conflict that begins and does not end, 
            from which you (with your mind, heart and soul) come out as a loser, regardless of the victor. 
            Either you lose your principles and logic, or you lose your happiness and passion.
            However, it is not always possible to walk behind the heart and neglect the mind and thinking,
            and it is not possible to follow the mind and neglect the heart. 
        </p>

         <h2 style="color: green;" title="The third cartoon"> Justice and Equality </h2> 
        <p> Through this artwork, I want to clarify <q> the difference between justice and equality </q>.
            Where the concepts of justice and equality are related to each other, 
            but justice is not always equal and equal between the parties in various cases and matters, 
            as it indicates impartiality in the treatment according to the controls followed, 
            so that if the rights of the disputing parties are similar, equality must be fair between them, 
            but if the rights differ, each takes One of the parties is exactly what it deserves, 
            even if the outcome is unequal between the parties.
